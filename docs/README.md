## üß≠ Getting Started

These instructions are intentionally generic so they can be adapted to the project's language and structure. Replace the placeholders below with the actual commands from the repository code.

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Python 3.8+ or Node.js 14+ (depending on implementation)
- (Optional) Docker

### Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SatyamSingh-Git/Computer-Use-Agent.git
cd Computer-Use-Agent
```

### Install dependencies

If the project is Python-based:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If the project is Node.js-based:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Configuration

Create a config file (e.g., `config.yaml` or `.env`) with your preferences:

```yaml
# Example config (replace with actual config options from the repo)
agent_name: "ComputerUseAgent"
log_level: "info"
skills:
  - clipboard
  - windows-management
  - scheduler
```

### Run the agent

Replace the run command with the actual entry point from the repository.

Python example:
```bash
python run_agent.py
```

Node.js example:
```bash
node src/index.js
```

Docker example:
```bash
docker build -t computer-use-agent .
docker run -it --rm computer-use-agent
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage Examples

- Start the agent and ask it to open an application.
- Schedule a task to run a script at a specific time.
- Let the agent manage window layouts for an efficient workspace.

(Provide concrete command examples / API calls here once you identify the actual project's entry points and interfaces.)

## üß™ Tests

If tests exist, run them with:

Python:
```bash
pytest
```

Node.js:
```bash
npm test
```

Add or improve tests to increase confidence and maintainability.
